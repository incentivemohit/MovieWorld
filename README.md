# MovieWorld

# How TO BUILD: MovieWorld is the site where you can get movie information. I have used react.js and bootstrap technology for building this project in which i have used functional components approach to make a component. There are 5 folders each folder has its own .js and .css file .These folders are Home, Header,Trending, Popular and MovieDetails. Home folder contains Home.js file basically it displays homepage of this project where a horizontal scrollable component and a vertical component exists. Header contains only name of the Site. Trending folder contains a TrendingMovies.js file ans its css file. Similarly, Popular folder contains js and css file . MoviesDetails folder contains js and css file it displays the detail page of fetched movie information through TMDB api when user click on movie poster on homepage. I have used TMDB API to develop this project. I have used axios for fetching api. 

# How To Run: First of all, open vs code and go to movie-world folder using cd movie-world then press enter. Now Type npm start then press enter. Server will get started and a homepage will appear.Now , you are free to click on any movie poster to get information about that.As you click on poster, detail page will appear where some details will be available related to movie.
# ThankYou


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
